Relations with Muro
-----------------------
Muro is built on top of FreeBSD. The aim of the Muro team is to stay as
close to the original source as possible. Muro can be installed on
a standard FreeBSD installation, this way a hosted system can be converted
easily to run Muro. A bootstrap script is available to make the installation
process a joyful experience.

  To convert your FreeBSD hosted installation to Muro, see the Muro
  bootstrap script on `Muro's update tools @ github <https://github.com/opnsense/update/>`__
